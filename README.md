# resp_des

A new Flutter responsive project.

## Getting Started

This were inspired by Simon, something I still need to work on.....

‘PlatformDispatcher’ 

    // Presently, on Android and Web this collection will only contain the
      /// display that the current window is on. On iOS, it will only contains the
      /// main display on the phone or tablet. On Desktop, it will contain only
      /// a main display with a valid refresh rate but invalid size and device
      /// pixel ratio values.
      // TODO(dnfield): Update these docs when https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/125939
      // and https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/125938 are resolved.

'SystemChrome'
  /// ### iOS
  ///
  /// This setting will only be respected on iPad if multitasking is disabled.
  ///
  /// You can decide to opt out of multitasking on iPad, then
  /// setPreferredOrientations will work but your app will not
  /// support Slide Over and Split View multitasking anymore.
  ///
  /// Should you decide to opt out of multitasking you can do this by
  /// setting "Requires full screen" to true in the Xcode Deployment Info.
